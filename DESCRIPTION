Description: Easy-to-use functions to generate 2-7 sets Venn plot in publication quality. 
  ggVennDiagram plot Venn using well-defined geometry dataset and ggplot2. The shapes of 2-4 sets 
  Venn use circles and ellipses, while the shapes of 4-7 sets Venn use irregular polygons (4 has both forms), which 
  are developed and imported from another package `venn`, authored by Adrian Dusa. We provided internal functions to 
  integrate shape data with user provided sets data, and calculated the geometry of every regions/intersections 
  of them, then separately plot Venn in three components: set edges, set labels, and regions.
  From version 1.0, it is possible to customize these components as you demand in ordinary ggplot grammar.
