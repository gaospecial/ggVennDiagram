# ggVennDiagram 1.0

* We completely rebuild `ggVennDiagram` in v1.0. It is now has well-defined data structure and maybe more elegant in coding.
* Although all of the main functions are retained, the usage of a few functions has been modified. This may cause capacity issues.
* If you find a bug or have questions, feel free to open a issue in [GitHub](https://github.com/gaospecial/ggVennDiagram/issues).

## Features

* support up to 7 sets Venn diagram. We thank the author of `venn` providing required edge shape datasets.
* user can modify the edge/label just use ordinary ggplot functions, without extra knowledge.
* less memory usage and maybe more faster.
* a lot of helper functions.

# ggVennDiagram 0.5

* Intersection values can be obtained and visualized now. See [README](./README.md) for more information;

* Bug fixings.
